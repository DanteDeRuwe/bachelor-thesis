cd thesis
bash compile.sh --include-proposal
```
The output pdf should be in `/thesis/build`.

### Prerequisites

The compile script makes use of `latexmk` and other MikTeX packages.

- Make sure you have MikTeX installed. 
- If you are having issues with `latexmk`, read the docs [here](https://mg.readthedocs.io/latexmk.html). 
- On Windows it could be necessary to download Perl, you can find it [here](https://www.perl.org/)
