# Feedback with Mr. Vertonghen

# Monday, Feb 15th

### Questions
1. In my proposal, I started with the need for distributed development, to provide a solution in the form of the MFarchitecture.
    - Is this a good idea or
    - Should I start from MF? Is the motivation for adopting this pattern clear enough?
2.  About the POC, in your opinion, what characteristics should it have
    - large-scale is already clear from the motivations of adopting the MF pattern 

### Answers
1. Keep the common thread throughout the thesis-"story". It makes it much more readable and provides insight
2. It should be
    - Large-scale
    - easily understandable (e-commerce site, student portal, ...)
    - something useful 
    - really showcase the MF pattern and its use

### Remarks and tips
1. If you find some rabbit-hole ideas that are too deep or out-of-scope for this thesis, maybe write accompanying blog articles and link them in a footnote or appendix. 
    - this is nice for interested readers
    - it gives you exposure in the expert field
2. Don't forget the link with microservices
3. Be sure your bachelor thesis (or the summary) can be pitchable to companies who are looking for ways to implement MF in Blazor
4. Make sure not everything is positive: show and explain some caveats
