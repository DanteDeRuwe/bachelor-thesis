  abstract  = {The content management system is an indispensable part of enterprise information construction. With the rise of the concept of front and rear separation and the maturity of related technologies, it is a better choice to create a multi-functional front-end web application in complex large-sized or medium-sized projects, which sits on top of a microservices-based architecture. As the business grows, the single front end becomes more and more bloated, resulting in a single page application that is not well scaled and deployed, and difficult to maintain. Based on the analysis of above problems, combined with the corresponding front-end technology, this paper applies the microservice concept to the development of front-end and proposes a design scheme of content management system based on micro frontends. Besides, the key issues in practice process, such as micro frontends design concept and implementation methods are described in detail.}
