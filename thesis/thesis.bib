At the same time, academic work on the topic is at an early stage, and still on the way to distilling the actual “Pains & Gains” of microservices as an architectural style. Having witnessed this gap, we set forth to systematically analyze the industrial grey literature on microservices, to identify the technical/operational pains and gains of the microservice-based architectural style. We conclude by discussing research directions stemming out from our analysis.}
